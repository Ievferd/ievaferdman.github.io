        <h3>Duration</h3>
        <p>5 weeks, 2021</p>
        <h3>Team</h3>
        <p>Ieva, Ingrid, Kristin and Lina</p>
        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>
          Our project aims to provide education on sexual health, physical
          well-being, and the rights of WSW (KSK in Norwegian) to both WSW
          individuals and healthcare professionals.
        </p>
        <h3>Target Audience</h3>
        <p>
          Our focus is on women of all age groups who may have limited or no
          information about their well-being and rights, specifically those who
          engage in relationships with women.
        </p>
        <h3>Rationale</h3>
        <p>
          In Norway, an estimated 5000 WSW individuals lack sufficient access to
          accurate information and guidance regarding their related health and
          rights issues. Our initiative seeks to bridge this information gap and
          empower this community with essential knowledge.

        <h3>Stakeholder Interview</h3>
        <p>
          We conducted a one-on-one interview, engaging with a knowledgeable
          representative from Sex og Samfunn, a clinic where our stakeholder
          serves as a nurse. The interview, conducted as a team through a
          45-minute Zoom session after working hours, revealed key insights:

        <h3>Survey</h3>
        <p>
          We conducted a 11-question survey using a Google Survey link to gather
          insights in a non-intimidating manner. This approach allowed us to
          understand respondent motivations, pain points, and priorities while
          ensuring a private environment for open and honest feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          The survey aimed to capture valuable opinions and comments, providing
          a baseline for future benchmarks. Combined with insights from a
          stakeholder interview, the survey results will inform the development
          of a unique product tailored to unmet needs in Norway.

        <li>
          Many healthcare professionals lack education on WSW topics and make

        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>
          Women who have sex with women encounter difficulties accessing
          relevant information about sexual health and mental well-being
          tailored to their population. Establishing a platform offering
          comprehensive resources on sex, sexual health, and mental health for
          WSW has the potential to positively impact this population, providing
          support and knowledge on often overlooked topics.

        <ol>
          <li>
            How might we normalize and present WSW education in an engaging and
            enjoyable manner?
          </li>
          <li>
            How might we simplify the learning process for WSW to explore
            relevant topics?
          </li>
          <li>
            How might we inspire and encourage WSW to proactively seek

        <h3>Mind Mapping</h3>
        <p>
          Ideas are crucial, and mind mapping proved invaluable for organizing a
          wealth of information, responses, and survey findings. This method
          fostered creativity, displayed hierarchy, facilitated discussions on
          potential solutions rooted in research data, and illustrated
          relationships between our ideas. The collaborative and productive
          atmosphere enhanced our ability to move forward. In the pursuit of
          refining our proposed AI and avoiding assumptions, we conducted card
          sorting testing.
        </p>
        <h3>Card Sorting</h3>
        <p>
          Utilizing OptimalSort for insights, we created 16 cards across 6
          categories (Definitions, Home Screen, STIs, Your Body, Mental Health,
          and Sexuality). The testing validated our assumptions, and 71% of
          participants successfully completed the study in a median time of
          03:21. With a completion rate of 71%, the process proved helpful,
          emphasizing its importance in our overall development process.

        <h3>Prototyping</h3>
        <p>
          Drawing inspiration from Information Architecture (IA), user flow, and
          task flow, we initiate the sketching phase to explore diverse website
          designs. Employing low-fidelity methods and various tools such as
          Miro, InVision, and others, we bring these ideas to life.

        <h3>Design System</h3>
        <p>
          In team collaboration, we established a style guide covering
          typography, website components, and layout details. Using a 12-column
          grid ensured consistency in spacing and alignment. Initial sketches
          gave a content overview, and high-fidelity desktop wireframes were
          created for usability testing, with a focus on desktop design for this
          project.

        <h3>Reflections and Learnings</h3>
        <h4>Logistics</h4>
        <p>
          Recruitment challenges surfaced in the empathy and ideate stages due
          to our target users' elusive nature. Bias was evident in low response
          rates, impacting sampling accuracy. Card sorting for ideation faced
          obstacles with desktop-exclusive testing, yielding fewer results.
        </p>
        <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
        <p>
          Moderate-remote testing proved time-intensive for participant
          recruitment, but the sessions provided valuable insights. Recognizing
          the necessity for ongoing testing, we refined our ideas and addressed
          technical improvements.
        </p>
        <h4>Design Thinking Process</h4>
        <p>
          Navigating a sparse landscape of resources on women's health and WSW
          in the empathy stage highlighted our project's uniqueness. The
          non-linear nature of design thinking became explicit, emphasizing the
          importance of flexibility and empathy in propelling the process
          forward.
        </p>
        <h4>Stakeholder Collaboration</h4>
        <p>
          While team collaboration effectively distributed work, improved
          internal communication and more frequent meetings could have enhanced
          efficiency. Additional stakeholder involvement throughout the process
          would have facilitated continuous feedback and refinement.
        </p>
        <h4>Team Dynamics</h4>
        <p>
          Despite geographical differences, the team collaborated well,
          leveraging diverse skills. Recognizing user needs and aligning with
          the business brief remained consistent. While meetings were limited,
          the team's collective effort aims to make a meaningful impact on
          women's awareness in Norway.
