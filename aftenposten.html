        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          Extensive desktop research indicates a significant shift in media
          consumption patterns, with audio playing an increasingly integral role
          in daily life. Leading publishers like The Washington Post, News24,
          Nettavisen, and Forbes Italia have embraced text-to-speech services.
          Notably, Zetland, a Danish publishing house, has journalists reading
          articles, revealing that approximately 75% of content is consumed
          through audio
        </p>
        <p>
          The momentum towards audio news and spoken word is evident among major
          publishers and media creators, and we anticipate this trend will
          persist and grow.
        </p>
        <picture>
          <source
            srcset="./img/project-aftenposten/aftenposten_3.png"

        <p>
          We hypothesized that incorporating Audio Articles would significantly
          impact news consumption, attract more users to Aftenposten, and boost
          subscription numbers. To examine this hypothesis, we posed the
          question:
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>How do Aftenposten readers respond to audio articles?</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Can we produce audio articles of high quality to entice new
            subscribers?
          </li>
          <li>
            Is it possible to cultivate a habit among users to consistently
            engage with audio content?
          </li>
          <li>
            Can we deliver a superior voice experience compared to other
            publishing platforms?
          </li>
        </ol>

          />
        </picture>
        <h3>Design Sprint</h3>
        <p>
          Our objective was to ascertain how users respond to the playback of
          pre-recorded human-read articles in comparison to conventional text
          and image-based articles. Drawing insights from the Design Sprint
          problems and hypotheses, we devised a solution:
          <b>the implementation of a static and sticky player.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          To assess its effectiveness, we tested the prototype using an article
          and an audio recording of "Gutten som aldri fikk fred," lasting 26
          minutes and 57 seconds.
        </p>

            alt="Usability testing"
          />
        </picture>
        <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
        <p><b>During the interview:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Context questions about news consumption</li>
          <li>Test prototype including follow-up questions</li>
          <li>Task questions, related to news and audio consumption.</li>
          <li>Deep-dive questions</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Participants:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            6 Norwegians with the following criteria (3 female and 3 male)
          </li>
          <li>Ages between 30 and 60 years old, living around Oslo.</li>
          <li>Read Aftenposten at least once a week.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Key takeaways:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>They wanted to listen to news not a feature story.</li>
          <li>
            Article was too long and they didn’t like the theme of the article.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users prefer consuming news through the phone and while commuting.
          </li>
          <li>Users confuse audio articles with podcast episodes.</li>
          <li>
            Article content determines whether users will engage with the
            article.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <picture>
          <source
            srcset="./img/project-aftenposten/aftenposten_6.png"
            media="(max-width:767px)"
          />

          />
        </picture>
        <p>
          Taking user feedback on player and usability into account, we crafted
          a player aligned with the Aftenposten brand.
        </p>
        <p><b>Our approach involved:</b></p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Ensuring that typography and icons are prominent and easy to read.
          </li>
          <li>
            Streamlining the player to be less intrusive, providing an
            uncluttered view for users who prefer reading.
          </li>
          <li>
            Regrettably, we were constrained to implementing only a static
            player due to technical challenges.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Engagement</h3>
        <p>
          How can we predict reader engagement with this article? We opted to
          integrate an audio version on the Aftenposten website.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>
            "Our initial hypothesis suggested that some users might not be
            interested in long feature article audio. However, we observed a
            notable approval for audio features in these articles, indicating a
            substantial user preference for audio engagement."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          While Click-Through Rate (CTR) isn't the most reliable metric, as
          clicks could be driven by curiosity or accidental actions, the average
          listen length becomes crucial. Analyzing the results, it's evident
          that those interested in the audio version listen to approximately 75%
          of the entire article.
        </p>
        <h3>Why is a 3,6% CTR considered good?</h3>
        <p>
          In discussions with The Washington Post's Senior Product Manager, it
          was asserted that anything close to 1% is commendable. Currently, we
          regard a 3.6% CTR as excellent, acknowledging that it may evolve due
          to the Novelty Effect. This effect occurs when users interact with a
          feature simply because it's new. Despite readers' inherent
          inconsistency in behavior and content consumption, a consistent
          platform fosters trust and can shape new habits around news
          consumption.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking ahead, we plan to monitor the growth and monthly return to the
          audio player, identifying users who have developed a habit of
          listening to articles. Additionally, exploring the context in which
          users prefer to listen to audio articles promises to provide valuable
          insights.
        </p>
        <h3>Future initiatives</h3>
        <p>
          Continuously track the growth and monthly engagement with the audio
          player to identify users who have cultivated a habit of listening to
          articles. Exploring the context in which users prefer to listen to
          audio articles could provide valuable insights for enhancing the
          overall user experience.

        </picture>
        <h3>Synthetic vs Human voice</h3>
        <p>
          Earlier tests focused on pre-recorded human-read articles, raising
          questions about the optimal number of human voices needed per article.
          To address cost considerations, we also explored the financial
          implications of using human-recorded articles compared to automated
          voice integration.
        </p>
        <p>
          To shed light on this, we initiated a test to evaluate the
          significance between two voices: synthetic versus human-read. Our aim
          is to discern how listeners respond to each voice type, providing
          valuable insights for future decision-making.
        </p>
        <picture>
          <source
            srcset="./img/project-aftenposten/aftenposten_9.png"
            media="(max-width:767px)"
          />
          <img

            alt="Usability testing"
          />
        </picture>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
          While listeners exhibit a preference for the human voice, the
          statistical significance observed in this test is 14%, which may not
          be considered substantial. Anticipating potential improvements, we
          expect that the introduction of a custom synthesized voice could
          narrow the gap between human and robotic voices.
        </p>

          />
        </picture>
        <h3>“Fake Door” Test</h3>
        <p>
          In the "Fake Door" or "Smoke" test, we aimed to assess user interest
          in integrating a new feature into the subscription model. The test,
          designed for non-subscribers behind the Aftenposten paywall, presented
          a user-friendly experience. Users encountered a player information
          panel leading to a brief feedback form with three simple questions
          about the audio, avoiding potential user annoyance.
        </p>
        <p>
          To mitigate disappointment, we considered providing access to a full
          audio article version after form submission. Technical difficulties
          prevented us from completing the test before the internship concluded,
          but we encourage Aftenposten to explore further opportunities for
          audio articles. Despite not conducting the "Fake Door" test, insights
          from the design sprint, engagement tests, and A/B testing consistently
          point towards a promising possibility.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h1>Audio has a future in Aftenposten!</h1>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          After our tests, we talked to the Senior Product Manager of Audio at
          The Washington Post, who has successfully used Text-to-Speech. Our
          findings match what we expected from our design planning: to make
          audio a more central part of reading articles, we should make the
          experience more like a podcast than traditional news reading.
        </p>
        <p>
          This includes features like curated playlists based on user
          preferences, the ability to queue articles, and a front page designed
          with audio in mind. This shift aims to improve how long users stay
          engaged, increase subscription value, and provide a better experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          While working on the design, questions about playlists and the front
          page suggest that Aftenposten might need to create a whole new way for
          readers/listeners to use its website and app.
        </p>
        <p><i> Update on 2024</i></p>
        <p>
          Aftenposten has introduced an audio experience for lengthy evergreen
          articles on both their website and app. This integrates a preview of
          the audio content with a subscription-based model.
