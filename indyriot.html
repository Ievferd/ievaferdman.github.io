          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            During the project, senior management made the strategic decision to
            revamp the product, aligning it more closely with customer needs and
            business objectives. Over the course of one year, the product
            underwent a transformation, transitioning from a traditional website
            building platform to a new, faster solution capable of delivering
            advanced features.<br />
            Throughout this period, I played a key role in the transition
            process, successfully implementing a completely new look and
            navigation system within a few months, all while ensuring continuity
            for existing clients on the "old" platform.

          <h3>Where do we start?</h3>
          <p>
            In switching from our current website platform, we found that users
            are craving more interaction with content and the community. Our
            previous platform lacked engagement, making it difficult to update
            and add new features. Before diving into designing a new navigation
            structure, we decided to quickly compare with our competitors.

            <h3>Quick iterations and fast releases</h3>
            <p>
              Due to frequent releases, often several times a week or even
              multiple times a day, we had limited time for documentation.
              However, we maintained regular communication with management to
              prioritize design tasks. <br />
              Weekly calls with users allowed us to iterate and gather feedback
              efficiently. Our development process relied on React and Tailwind
              to build components and achieve a platform appearance that users
              found familiar and comfortable.

            <h3>First releases and feedback</h3>
            <p>
              After our initial releases and gathering user feedback, we crafted
              the following problem hypothesis:
            </p>
            <div class="insights">
              <div class="left-insights">
                <p>
                  If we offer an <b>efficient and intuitive navigation</b>,
                  users will find it easier to accomplish their goals, discover
                  value in the product, and develop a habit of using it to
                  interact with others, find engaging content, and share their
                  own knowledge.

              <div class="right-insights">

                    >customers can organize their content and activities
                    intuitively</b
                  >, meeting their needs for flexibility and structure, they
                  will communicate more effectively within their community,
                  manage conversations adeptly, and boost engagement within
                  their community.
                </p>

          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Why did users still not engage with the content?</h3>
            <p>
              Customers have diverse organizational structures and content
              needs, along with varying terminology. The concept of "Spaces"
              provides a scalable solution for each customer to create a
              structure tailored to their content and conversation organization.
              Users can opt to follow "Spaces" based on their interests,
              necessitating navigation that accommodates exploration of numerous
              spaces, some to follow.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alongside Spaces, we have Global Features, integral to all
              communities, which must be included in the navigation for the
              community to function effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              Customers who were invested in the initial product desired the
              same features, including the ability to reorganize pages and
              navigation structures and to brand the community to reflect their
              unique style.
            </p>
            <p>
              Implementing guided onboarding to clarify terminology and
              facilitate connections with individuals they may already know from
              their business (company or organization) (part of another project
              I worked on).

            <h3>Importance of Mobile Optimization</h3>
            <p>
              During user interviews, including in-person, online, and guerrilla
              testing among students in Oslo, we found that the majority of
              users preferred mobile-first usage. Only management and community
              administrators, who set up and monitor the community, preferred
              desktop.<br />We quickly realized the importance of prioritizing
              mobile accessibility as a digital product, given the widespread
              use of smartphones and tablets. Without it, users may encounter
              difficulties accessing or navigating the product on smaller
              screens, leading to a subpar user experience and potential loss of
              engagement.

            <h3>Final Deliverables</h3>
            <p>
              Towards the end of my tenure, there were shifts in management and
              evolving priorities, impacting the final outcome of the product.
              During the project's concluding phase, disagreements across
              departments arose concerning navigation and its components.
              Unfortunately, my proposed design and user preferences were not
              upheld.
